# emotion-detection-python
Detecting emotions in Python using CNN and deep learning: analyzing images or text to recognize feelings, like happiness or sadness. CNNs excel in image analysis, while deep learning models process text to classify emotions. Useful in various applications like social media sentiment analysis and human-computer interaction.

This code employs Keras, a Python library for high-level neural networks. Keras seamlessly interfaces with deep learning backends like TensorFlow, used here for emotion detection from images using a pre-trained model. It's a potent combination for classifying emotions, simplifying complex tasks in Python.
